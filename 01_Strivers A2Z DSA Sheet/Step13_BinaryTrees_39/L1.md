Types of BT :
1. Full binary tree : either two or no leaves nodes
2. Complete binary tree : all levels are completely filled except last level ( filled from left to right)
3. Perfect BT :  all leaves nodes are at same level
4. Balanced BT :  height of BT should be log(n) { n : no. of nodes}.
5. Degenerate BT : skewed BT.
