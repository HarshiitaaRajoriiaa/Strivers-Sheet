# Tree is hierarchical data structure
## Common Terminologies-
* Root Node :  top most node
* Branches
* Leaf Node: node with 0 children
* parent Node: node with 0 or 1 or 2 node atleast
* Ancestor: parent node of the current node and parent node of the parent of parent node till root node.
* Level
* Depth
* Sub-Tree, Left-Sub-Tree, Right-Sub-Tree,

# Types of Binary Tree:
1. Full Binary Tree : Node can have either 0 nodes or two nodes.
2. Complete Binary Tree:Should be completely filled, last level should have nodes on the left as possible.
3. Perfect Binary Tree:All leaf nodes should be at same level.
4. Balanced Binary Tree:Height of tree should be log(n) n -- nodes 
5. Degenerated Binary Tree: or called Skewed Binary Tree , one node have only one child either in left most direction or right most direction.



# Order
1. PreOrder: Root - Left -  Right
2. InOrder: Left - Root - Right
3. PostOrder: left - Right - Root
   
# Search 
1. B.F.S = Breadth first Search / Level Wise Search
2. D.F.S = Depth first Search / Depth Wise Search
