**HEAP-**

1. Deletion MIN/MAX = 0(logn)
2. Accessing MIN/MAX = 0(1)
3. Inserting Element = 0(logn)
   
   For accessing min or max element from any data structure in lesser time.
   Visualize Heap as Complete Binary Tree.





**Manipulating heaps as an Array for better and easy Operations-** no need of pointers, memory efficient, fast to navigate(Linear)

**Child and Parents**
1. if starting from zero = 2i+1 , 2i+2
2. if starting from 1 = 2i , 2i+1
3. parent for child i = i-1/2
